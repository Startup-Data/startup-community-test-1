# startup-community-test-1

There are many  OpenSource project on git Repos site with MIT license which are like one treasure, so by writing some automatic team making scripts those project could be one startup and those who have good progress could have more consulting services.  So I am trying to build one site to grab the MIT licence project from  Git Repos sites and suggest one startup by using some of the FREE Startups tools said here:  https://github.com/Ibexoft/awesome-startup-tools-list 

The final result could be one community via the internet for startup teams working with it's digital money as it's revenew and one parameter as it's  efficiency
